This class is a microservice which communicates with the google bucket storage, allowing for gettings signed URLS to download and upload problems automatically using them.

I need to integration test it with the Solver to make sure it works, but manual tests seem to confirm functionality, as all files in the bucket 'microservices22tasks_bucket' have been put there and downloaded automatically.
